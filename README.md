# time.ir qoutes

Hi,
i uasualy check time and (jalali)calendar on time.ir , if you browse http://time.ir/ you'll see the random qoute at the bottom of calendar,
i decided to scrap all of qoutes with a python script using BS4 :|
you can get all of time.ir random qoutes here at qoutes.txt


have fun!
